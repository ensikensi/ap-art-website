        <div class="about">
            <p>my name is kensington diefenderfer, and this is (mostly) the site for my ap art portfolio!
                i have been doing art since i could hold a crayon, and ive been making my own characters,
                worlds, and stories just as long. i love to explore my creativity in ways other than drawing,
                like writing, and coding.<br>
                i love webcomics, and stories, and making things with my friends, and all three of those things
                contributed to this portfolio and how this site looks!

        <h3>- my sustained investigation -</h3>
        <p>in the AP art world, you have something called a "sustained investigation", or the
            'theme' of your artwork and portfolio. mine is "exploring self-perception and how others
            percieve you through character design, world-building, and storytelling." i go on to make art,
            concepts, and designs all centered around this one topic.

    <div id="concept">
        <h1>CONCEPT ART</h1>
        <h3>- purpose of concept art -</h3>
        <p>because i am exploring an idea through the lens of characters, their designs, and their
            world/placement in the world, concept art is an important thing! it'll show the progression
            of their designs (even when they are just menial, seemingly useless changes), their thoughts
            and their purpose in the story and the art, and what they are trying to represent and show.
